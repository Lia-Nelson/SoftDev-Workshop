time spent: 2.3 hours

api key used to detect user who wants to access data and make sure nothing breaks
? breaks url and the query string
json -> important
json.dump -> dict to file, json.load -> files to dict

GET (must have caps) + url
such as: GET https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=BbBUhlazreBfN6DQvmGnAp6TcuBzsfUQJISPj1hK
inside of terminal
its a http GET request
returns what website sends in response to request

NEEDS Certificate which I don't have, therefore urlrequest fails when I try to use it
