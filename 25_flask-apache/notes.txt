Questions
* What is the function of mod_wsgi?
* Why can we no longer run $ sudo apt-get install python-pip and thus $ python __init__.py after Flask is installed? It seems like on our school machines we are able to run both $ python __init__.py and $ python3 __init__.py?

Comments
* Sudo perms must be utilized on droplets to make directories editable to users
* $ scp is a secure copy command that helps when copying folders to virtual machines
* SSH shortcuts make it easier to get into a droplet
  * I set up the shortcut for my user as $ ssh ev
* SSH keys should be set up on all devices that will be used to prevent problems with accessing droplets

Concerns
* It is important to make sure that my SSH setup is done on all devices (I should be sure to set up my shortcut on the lab machines)
