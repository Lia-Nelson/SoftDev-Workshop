Questions
* What is the function of mod_wsgi?
* Why can we no longer run $ sudo apt-get install python-pip and thus $ python __init__.py after Flask is installed? It seems like on our school machines we are able to run both $ python __init__.py and $ python3 __init__.py?

Comments
* Sudo perms must be utilized on droplets to make directories editable to users
* $ scp is a secure copy command that helps when copying folders to virtual machines
* SSH shortcuts make it easier to get into a droplet
  * I set up the shortcut for my user as $ ssh ev
* SSH keys should be set up on all devices that will be used to prevent problems with accessing droplets
* The permissions mode/configuration/flags:
 * 9 bits _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ user, group, world   r w x, r, w, x, r, w, x (1 or 0)
 * run `$ ls -al` to check permissions
 * run `$ chmod` to change permissions, (e.g. `$ chmod 770 <file>` (first, second, and third grouping but gets converted to base 2))
 * run `$ chgroup <user> <file>` to change permissions
* `$ top` gives a live feed of processes, hit q to quit
* www-data is apache, can do `$ chown <user> <file>`

Concerns
* It is important to make sure that my SSH setup is done on all devices (I should be sure to set up my shortcut on the lab machines)
