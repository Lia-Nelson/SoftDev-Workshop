DISCO
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down allows me to select multiple lines on Atom to
  edit at once on a Windows machine
* I can exit this lines with the Esc key
* Elements can be appended to document.body or document.head

QCC
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* What is the difference between the function name {};
  construction and the var name = function() {}; construction?
    Why does it seem that the second of those constructions must
    occur before the function is called whereas the first does
    not?
* Why did adding parentheses after the function associated with
  an event listener cause to run each time the HTML is loaded
  instead of upon click?
* JavaScript code will work on standards-compliant browser
* Developed because people want interactivity
* Provides another doorway for hackers (getting random code from
  some website and running it on your machine)
* Modern web browsers have sandboxing and added protections
* console.log() displays a string in the console

* No built in I/O (i.e. place to print to)

* Dynamically typed (not strictly)
* Even in Java where strictly typed takes a lot of resources to run
  instanceOf (checks types)

* document.getElementById(<ID>)
* document.getElementsByTagName(<TAG>)
* document.getElementsByClassName(<CLASS>)

* JS for user action awareness:
  .addEventListener(<EVENT>, <FUNCTION>)

* document.createElement(<HTML TAG NAME>)
* element.setAttribute(<NAME>, <VALUE>)
* element.getAttribute(<NAME>)

* element.remove()
* element.innerHTML
* element.appendChild(<ELEMENT>)
* element.addEventListener(<EVENT>, <FUNCTION>)

* How can we make sure that we are constructing our functions in
  a way that is appropriate?
