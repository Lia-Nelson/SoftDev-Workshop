-----------------------------------------------------------------
* JSON = JavaScript Standard Object Notation
   * Format:
      * Start and end with {}
      * Separate key and value with :
      * Separate key:value pair with ,
      * "Keys" surrounded by ""
      * Text based
* Keys in JSON are often referred to as fields in MongoDB
* BSON = Binary JSON
   * Faster parsing
   * Bridges gap between binary representation and JSON
   * Has been extended to support additional data types
* In JSON
   * mongoimport
   * mongoexport
* In BSON
   * mongorestore (import)
   * mongodump (export)
* Can files imported as BSON or JSON be exported as the other
  type?
* URI = uniform resource identifier
* srv establishes a secure connection
* namespace = the concatenation of the database name and
  collection name
* Queries must user valid JSON
   * Returned documents will contain the queried field:value
* Connecting to the Atlas cluster: mongo
  "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/
  admin"
* For the sake of this course:
  mongo "mongodb+srv://m001-student:m001-mongodb-basics@sandbox.dgjkc.mongodb.net/admin"
* show dbs  shows list of databases in cluster
* use database_name  selects database to work with
* show collections  shows collections in database
* db.collection.find(JSON QUERY)  runs a query
* it  stands for iterate, iterates through cursor
   * cursor is a pointer to the result set of a query
      * a pointer is a direct address of of the memory location
* .count()  gives the number of documents that satisfy a query
* .pretty() formats the documents in the cursor
* The find command without a query ({}) gives the first 20
  documents of the collection (not ordered)
* The mongo shell is a fully functioning JavaScript interpreter
