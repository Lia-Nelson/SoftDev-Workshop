Note:
According to SO, relational databases are unable to store lists of values unless you serialize them (convert them into byte code)
	- this is annoying as we now can't get unlimited of any field, or if we want to, we cannot do any meaningful SQL operations like sorting.
 
Should we be creating our own pages, or linking to preexisting ones (i.e. Wikipedia)?

Spending the time to focus on a design and assigning roles ensures that work is distributed fairly and that everyone gets to contribute input to the final product.

* Make sure to use PROTIPS found on Piazza for SQLite (etc.)
