* What version of ubuntu do we want to use? (Answered)
* What are the additional options for droplets?
* What are the other products that DigitalOcean offers (i.e. kubernetes)?

Comments
* You never want to configure your box so you ssh as ROOT@droplet, you should log in as a user
* Authentication should occur with ssh keys
* We don't want to enable backups ($1/mo), our code will be stored on GitHub
* $sudo apt install
  elevates privileges to that of the superuser so that commands can be run temporarily
* $sudo su
  will elevate you to the root, superuser for longer
  it will look like
  root..$
 * $su thluffy
   allows you to switch to another user, thluffy is a placeholder
 * $CH-D
  Stands for the keystroke of Command D, allows you to exit a shell
 * apt is the application management system for Ubuntu (aptitude), and makes installs easier by also installing everything that what is being installed is dependent upon

Notes about Droplets:

    Choose Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) for this class
    Choose the Basic (shared CPU plan)
    Pick Regular Intel and $5/mo
    Choose a datacenter in New York
    Use SSH keys for authentication

Questions:

    Should we select any additional options for our droplets?
    What should our droplet/hostname be?
    Can/should we use the same SSH keys as we did for GitHub?
