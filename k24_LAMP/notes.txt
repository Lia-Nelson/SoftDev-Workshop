## Questions
* What version of ubuntu do we want to use? (Answered)
* What are the additional options for droplets?
* What are the other products that DigitalOcean offers (i.e. kubernetes)?

# Comments
* You never want to configure your box so you ssh as ROOT@droplet, you should log in as a user
* Authentication should occur with ssh keys
* We don't want to enable backups ($1/mo), our code will be stored on GitHub

Notes about Droplets:

    Choose Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) for this class
    Choose the Basic (shared CPU plan)
    Pick Regular Intel and $5/mo
    Choose a datacenter in New York
    Use SSH keys for authentication

Questions:

    Should we select any additional options for our droplets?
    What should our droplet/hostname be?
    Can/should we use the same SSH keys as we did for GitHub?
