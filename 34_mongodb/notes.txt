QCC
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* What does RDBMS stand for?
* How does MongoDB foster easy changes to the data model?
  * What happens to data that is in the old format/model?
* Is there a fast way to avoid altering the design of the data
  model at any given phase of the application lifetime?
* Top-down vs. bottom-up approach to creating a data model
* How is the application workload evaluated? Is this done
  automatically? Does MongoDB keep track of how many times
  specific data is utilized for a specific purpose?
* Nice explanation of linking vs. embedding
* It seems as though there could be an issue when running the
  batch updater if the new/old data models are not easily
  compatible
   * To what extent is the batch update performed by the user?
* Tabular approach creates a new document for each reading
  (thermostat example)
* Document approach allows for a single document that covers
  readings within a specified time interval (bucket pattern
  implementation)
* What is an IoT reading?
* The computed pattern gives an average (useful descriptor of
  data)
   * Can either be counted and added each time (takes a lot of
     CPU work) or can be updated each time there is more data
     (e.g. sum and number of data points) to make computation
     more efficient
