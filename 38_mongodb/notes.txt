-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Find all documents where the tripduration was less than or
  equal to 70 seconds and the usertype was not Subscriber:
  * db.trips.find({ "tripduration": { "$lte" : 70 },
                "usertype": { "$ne": "Subscriber" } }).pretty()
* Find all documents where the tripduration was less than or
  equal to 70 seconds and the usertype was Customer using a
  redundant equality operator:
  * db.trips.find({ "tripduration": { "$lte" : 70 },
                "usertype": { "$eq": "Customer" }}).pretty()
  * $gte (greater than or equal to)
  * $lt (less than or equal to)
  * $gt (greater than or equal to)
* Find all documents where the tripduration was less than or
  equal to 70 seconds and the usertype was Customer using the
  implicit equality operator:
  * db.trips.find({ "tripduration": { "$lte" : 70 },
                "usertype": "Customer" }).pretty()
* $ uses:
  * precedes MQL operators
    * Query operators give different ways to locate data
    * Comparison operators let us find data within range
    * Logic operators are $and, $or, $nor and $not (no xor)
      * Why would nor be present but not xor (since both can
        be constructed from prior operators)?
  * precedes Aggregation pipeline stages
  * allows field value access
* Find all documents where airplanes CR2 or A81 left or landed
  in the KZN airport:
  * db.routes.find({ "$and": [ { "$or" :[ { "dst_airport": "KZN" },
                                    { "src_airport": "KZN" }
                                  ] },
                          { "$or" :[ { "airplane": "CR2" },
                                     { "airplane": "A81" } ] }
                         ]}).pretty()
* There is an implict and that can be utilized when applying
  multiple conditions to the same field
* If have to different or queries will assume that or combines
  them unless explicit and
* $not can only work on one clause
