-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Aggregation framework provides another way to query data
  * Use aggregate() command instead of find()
    * Input to command is an array
    * Acts as a pipeline where order of actions matters
    * $match will get data where fields match values
    * $project projects fields as result
    * $group allows compute and reshape data (siphons incoming
      data to multiple distinct reservoirs
    * $match, $project and $group are stage names proceeded by
      $
    * $sum adds value to total
* limit() limits the number of documents that can be displayed
  as a result
* sort({ <field>: <value> })
  * <value> can be -1 or 1
    * 1 sorts from least to most (increasing)
    * -1 sorts from most to least (decreasing)
* sort(), limit(), pretty() and count() are cursor methods
* using limit() without sort() returns random document(s)
* thus cursor.limit().sort() assumed mean cursor.sort().limit()
* index = database structure that stores a small portion of the
  collection's data set in any easy to traverse form
* Single field index - createIndex({<field>: <value>})
  * if value is, 1 increasing order
  * if -1 decreasing order
* Compound index - createIndex({<field>: <value>,
  <field>: <value>})
* Data modeling = way to organize data in document to support
  application performance and querying capabilities
* Data is stored in the way that it is used
  * Data that is used together should be stored together
  * Data model should evolve as application evolves
* Everything used to locate a document in MQL can also be used
  to modify it
* updateOne({<query to locate>},{<update>})
* upsert is a hybrid of upsert and insert that should only be
  used when needed
  * updateOne({<query to locate>},{<update>},{"upsert":true})
  * updates if there is a match
  * inserts if no documents match query
  * should not be used to only update existing document or
    create new one
* $inc creates field if it does not exist yet
* similarly, $push can both update and insert
