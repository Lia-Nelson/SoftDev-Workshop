-----------------------------------------------------------------
* NoSQL means does not employ tables, rows and columns for data
  organization
* Database means there is a structured way to store and access
  data
* A document is a way to organize and store data as a set of
  field-value pairs
   * How does this compare to a dictionary with key-value pairs?
* A collection is a group of objects; MongoDB utilizes
  collections of documents
* Clusters are groups of servers that store data
* A replica set contains a few connected MongoDB instances with
  the same data stored
   * An instance is a single machine running specific software
* MongoDB Atlas functions:
   * Manages cluster creation
   * Runs and maintains database deployment
   * Facilitates use of the user's desired cloud service
   * Allows experimentation with MongoDB
 * Why the name MDBU for the organization?
 * Loading the sample dataset is occurring VERY slowly
 * Hands on practice! :)
